
This project's goal is to develop my skills in Python and with algorithms and data structures by completing problems 1-100 from Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/).

Project Euler asks that, in general, people do not share the solutions to problems. Additionally,
"The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere." (https://projecteuler.net/about)
As such, this project will be confined to the first 100 problems. Others are more than welcome to ask questions about my solutions, as well as to suggest improvements.

Future work will 1) complete more problems and 2) provide comments and explanations for each algorithm.
